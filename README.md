This README is for a class project. I am supposed to write a "crappy" (the worst thing that happened since school started) and a "happy" (the best thing since school started).

My "happy" is the research I've had the opportunity to work on. I love gathering, cleaning, and analyzing real-world data. It gives me the opportunity to make a change in the world, and that's one of the most rewarding things I can imagine.
My "crappy" is the recent removal of certain government webpages. I believe in the power of publicly available-knowledge and the change that can be made through education. There are several subjects I haven't been able to fully research because the CDC and census Bureau have been limited in what they publicly display on their websites.
